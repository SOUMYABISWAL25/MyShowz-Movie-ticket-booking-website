## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: OTP Modal Not Showing

**Check Browser Console:**
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for these messages:
   ```
   AWS Amplify Auth initialized
   Development Mode: true
   Sign Up form listener attached
   DEV MODE: Simulating sign up for: [email]
   Opening verification modal for: [email]
   Modal element: [object HTMLDivElement]
   Modal display set to flex
   ```

**If modal doesn't appear, check:**
1. ‚úÖ JavaScript console for errors
2. ‚úÖ Network tab for failed script loads
3. ‚úÖ Make sure `amplify-auth.js` is loaded
4. ‚úÖ Verify CSS file `sign-in.css` is loaded

### Issue: Form Not Submitting

**Verify:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for message: `Sign Up form listener attached`
3. If not present, refresh the page
4. Check if jQuery is loaded: Type `$` in console

### Issue: Modal Appears But Can't Close

**Solutions:**
1. Click the √ó button in top-right corner

## üöÄ Production Mode (AWS Amplify)

### When Ready to Use Real AWS Authentication:

#### Step 1: Deploy Amplify Backend
```powershell
npx ampx sandbox
```

#### Step 2: Get Your Credentials
After deployment, you'll receive:
- User Pool ID (e.g., `ap-south-1_XXXXXXXXX`)
- User Pool Client ID (e.g., `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)

#### Step 3: Update Configuration
Edit `assets/js/amplify-auth.js`:
```javascript
const DEVELOPMENT_MODE = false; // Change to false

Amplify.configure({
    Auth: {
        Cognito: {
            userPoolId: 'ap-south-1_YOUR_POOL_ID',      // Your actual Pool ID
            userPoolClientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',          // Your actual Client ID
            loginWith: {
                email: true
            }
        }
    }
});
```

#### Step 4: Test with Real Emails
1. Sign up with a **real email address**
2. Check your email inbox for verification code
3. Enter the 6-digit code from email
4. Complete verification
